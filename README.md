# detect-age-from-an-image
#About the Project :
In this Python Project, I had used Deep Learning to accurately identify the gender and age of a person from a single image of a face. I used the models trained by Tal Hassner and Gil Levi. The predicted gender may be one of ‘Male’ and ‘Female’, and the predicted age may be one of the following ranges- (0 – 2), (4 – 6), (8 – 12), (15 – 20), (25 – 32), (38 – 43), (48 – 53), (60 – 100) (8 nodes in the final softmax layer). It is very difficult to accurately guess an exact age from a single image because of factors like makeup, lighting, obstructions, and facial expressions. And so, I made this a classification problem instead of making it one of regression.
